## Constraints

- **GitHub Pages base path** — Vite `base: "/password-generator/"` is required for deployment. Changing or removing it breaks the live site at `fabian20ro.github.io/password-generator/`.
- **Strict Content Security Policy** — The CSP in `index.html` is `default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src https://github.com; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'none'`. New scripts must be ES modules from same origin. External scripts and stylesheets are blocked.
- **Rejection sampling is intentional** — The `while (val >= REJECT_THRESHOLD)` loop in `src/password.ts` eliminates modulo bias. This is deliberate security hardening — do not simplify or remove it.
- **README is stale** — README says "5 passwords (23–27)" but the implementation generates 10 passwords (lengths 23–32). Treat the code as source of truth.
- **Zero runtime dependencies by design** — `package.json` has only `devDependencies`. This is intentional. Do not add runtime dependencies.

## Legacy & Deprecated

## Learning System

This project uses a persistent learning system. Follow this workflow every session:

1. **Start of task:** Read `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` — it contains validated corrections and patterns
2. **During work:** Note any surprises or non-obvious discoveries
3. **End of iteration:** Append to `ITERATION_LOG.md` with what happened
4. **If insight is reusable and validated:** Also add to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
5. **If same issue appears 2+ times in log:** Promote to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
6. **If something surprised you:** Flag it to the developer — they'll decide whether to fix the codebase, update LESSONS_LEARNED, or adjust this file

| File | Purpose | When to Write |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | Curated, validated wisdom and corrections | When insight is reusable |
| `ITERATION_LOG.md` | Raw session journal (append-only, never delete) | Every iteration (always) |

Rules: Never delete from ITERATION_LOG. Obsolete lessons → Archive section in LESSONS_LEARNED (not deleted). Date-stamp everything YYYY-MM-DD. When in doubt: log it.

### Periodic Maintenance
This project's config files are audited periodically using `SETUP_AI_AGENT_CONFIG.md`.
The maintenance protocol ensures all files stay lean and current. See that document's
"Periodic Maintenance Protocol" section for the full audit procedure.

## Sub-Agents

Specialized agents in `.claude/agents/`. Invoke proactively — don't wait to be asked.

| Agent | File | Invoke When |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Architect | `.claude/agents/architect.md` | System design, scalability, refactoring, ADRs |
| Planner | `.claude/agents/planner.md` | Complex multi-step features — plan before coding |
| UX Expert | `.claude/agents/ux-expert.md` | UI components, interaction patterns, accessibility |
| Agent Creator | `.claude/agents/agent-creator.md` | Need a new specialized agent for a recurring task domain |
